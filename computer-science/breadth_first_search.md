# Breadth First Search
Breadth first searching is an algorithm used to search graphs and trees by level. The code will start off by looking at the root, then its children, then the children's children etc. It looks at each level from left to right at one time. Therefore, the bottom right node in the data structure is evaluated last. Normally, you use a [queue](https://github.com/aspittel/coding_cheat_sheets/blob/master/data_structures/queue.md) to implement this sort of search.
